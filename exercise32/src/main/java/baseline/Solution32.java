//Write a Guess the Number game that has three levels of difficulty.
// The first level of difficulty would be a number between 1 and 10.
// The second difficulty set would be between 1 and 100.
// The third difficulty set would be between 1 and 1000.
//Based on the difficulty,
//The computer picks a random number in that range and prompts the player to guess that number.
// Each time the player guesses, the computer should give the player a hint as to whether
// the number is too high or too low. The computer should also keep track of the number of guesses.
// Once the player guesses the correct number,
// the computer should present the number of guesses and ask if the player would like to play again.
//Donâ€™t allow any non-numeric data entry.
//During the game, count non-numeric entries as wrong guesses.
